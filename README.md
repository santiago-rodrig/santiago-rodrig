I'm Santiago, a full-stack web developer specialized in Ruby on Rails, I studied in the

## What I'm currently learning? :brain:

I'm currently honing my skills with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/),
next I'm planning to increase my [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) powers.

## FAQ :question:

#### Do I have a full-time job right now?

The answer is no, I'm **open to new opportunities** and I'm
**hungry for knowledge** :bowtie:.

#### What is my preferred stack?

__Ruby on Rails__ and **React.js** for now, as a web developer, I'm obviously
proficient with [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), I could probably
mention [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), but that is
implicit when you state that you are a Ruby on Rails developer, something
similar happens with
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), you have
to know JavaScript before starting with React.js.

#### Dogs or cats?

Fishes :fish:.

## Fun fact :thinking:

Do you know how many years are in a light year? According to
[Wikipedia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year)...

> It is equal to just under 10 trillion kilometres (or about 6 trillion miles).
> As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the
> distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year.
